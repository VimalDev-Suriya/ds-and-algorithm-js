/**
 * Subsequence
 * Contigeous and non-contigenous sequences with follows the ORDER
 * Consider the arr = [3, 2, 1]
 * Ths subsequence are
 * [1], [2], [3], [3, 2], [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2, 1]
 *
 * [3, 1] - is the non-contigeous
 * remaining all are contigeous
 * [2, 3], [1, 2] are not in ORDER so its not subsequence
 *
 * Subarray is also a subsequences, but not vice versa
